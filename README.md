# FANG PROJECT

This project attempts to re-create the FANG (Freely Available Networked Game)Java Game Engine described in the book Introductory Programming with Simple Games

## Motivation

As part of the CRVG project I picked up this book to read for ideas on Game Engines. 
I was disappointed to find out that all the links in the book were no longer available. 
The [main website](http://www.fangengine.org) is now apparently a totally unrelated site. The
book's website and the recommended [IDE website](http://www.javawide.org/)are no longer available.

I searched the Internet for two days trying to find any source code. I decided it would be more of a challenge
to try to reverse engineer FANG. It will allow me to:
- keep my Java skills up to date
- allow someone foolish enough to purchase the book (over $100 on amazon!) to be able to work with it
- build something that may be useful to someone

Similar to my efforts on CRVG project I will document my journey in a documents sections under the repo 300-days-of-code.
